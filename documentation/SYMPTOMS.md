# Symptoms — Cross-system Compatibility

How HDS symptom items map to external systems and clinical terminologies.

## External Systems Overview

### Apple HealthKit (39 symptom types)

Apple uses a **flat list** of symptom identifiers under `HKCategoryTypeIdentifier`. No sub-categories in the API, but logically groupable by body system.

**Value types:**
- **HKCategoryValueSeverity** (used by 36/39 symptoms): Unspecified (0), NotPresent (1), Mild (2), Moderate (3), Severe (4)
- **HKCategoryValuePresence** (2 symptoms): Present (0), NotPresent (1) — used by `moodChanges`, `sleepChanges`
- **HKCategoryValueAppetiteChanges** (1 symptom): Unspecified (0), NoChange (1), Decreased (2), Increased (3)

**Complete list by body system:**

#### Gastrointestinal (7)
| HealthKit Identifier | Value Type |
|---|---|
| abdominalCramps | Severity |
| bloating | Severity |
| constipation | Severity |
| diarrhea | Severity |
| heartburn | Severity |

### SNOMED CT / HL7 FHIR

**SNOMED CT** organizes symptoms under **404684003 |Clinical finding|**, grouped by body system via the `Finding site` attribute.

| Body System | SNOMED Concept ID | Example symptoms |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Digestive system | 53619000 | nausea (73879007), bloating (236653009) |
| Nervous system | 118940003 | headache (25064002), dizziness (404640003) |
| Respiratory system | 50043002 | cough, dyspnea, wheezing |
| Musculoskeletal system | 928000 | joint pain, back pain |
| General/constitutional | 162408000 | fatigue (84229001), malaise, fever |

**FHIR modeling:**
- **Observation** (category: `survey` or `symptom`) — for point-in-time patient-reported symptoms
- **Condition** — for persistent/recurring symptoms on a problem list
- **Questionnaire / QuestionnaireResponse** (SDC profile) — for structured symptom diary entries
- Rule of thumb: episodic self-reports → Observation; persistent patterns → Condition

**Relevant code systems:**
- SNOMED CT `Clinical finding` hierarchy — primary coding backbone
- LOINC — for structured questionnaire items
- ICD-10 Chapter R — supplementary grouping (symptoms, signs, abnormal findings)

### Ovia Health

Ovia tracks **100+ symptoms** across these categories (no public API; reconstructed from research papers and app content):

- **Period-related**: spotting (with color), flow intensity, discharge
- **Physical**: headaches, migraines, cramps, backache, breast tenderness, nausea, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, hot flashes, acne, fatigue, mittelschmerz
- **Behavioral**: mood (10+ options), sleep patterns, sex drive, cravings, appetite changes
- **Cervical**: fluid quality/amount, position (height/firmness/opening)
- **Menopause additions**: hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood swings
- **Postpartum additions**: birth recovery, postpartum mood states

Most symptoms recorded as **presence flags** (not severity-graded).

### Mira

**API structure** (`symptoms` field in daily log):
```json
"symptoms": [
  { "value": "Headache", "level": "Mild" },
  { "value": "Nausea", "level": "Mild" },
  { "value": "Cravings" }
]
```

- `value` (string, required): symptom name
- `level` (string, optional): severity — only "Mild" documented, likely also "Moderate"/"Severe"
- Flat array, no categorization in the API
- API is read-only; no schema enumerating valid values

**All 22 confirmed symptom values (from real Mira prod API, 2026-03-17):**

| Mira value | Apple HealthKit match | SNOMED CT |
|---|---|---|
| Headache | `headache` (Severity) | 25064002 |
| Migraine | `headache` (Severity) | 37796009 |

| Weight fluctuations | — (quantitative: `bodyMass`) | — (derived) |

**Separate Mira daily log fields** (not in `symptoms` array):
- `mood` — e.g. "Excited", "Exhausted" (see MOOD.md)
- `skin` — e.g. "Dry", "Glowing" (see SKIN.md)
- `sex_drive` — e.g. "High", "Neutral", "Low"
- `cervical_mucous` — object with `description` and `volume`
- `cervical_position` — object with `height`, `openness`, `texture`

## Symptom vs Observation vs Condition

Some concepts tracked as "symptoms" in consumer apps are clinically classified differently:

| Concept | SNOMED semantic tag | Apple HealthKit | Clinical note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acne | **disorder** (11381005) | symptom (`acne`) | Self-reported = symptom; diagnosed = condition |
| Hirsutism | **disorder** (66520009) | — | Endocrine disorder; self-reported = symptom |
| Insomnia | **disorder** (193462001) | symptom (`sleepChanges`) | Sleep disorder (ICD-10: G47.0); "difficulty sleeping" is a symptom |
| Anxiety | **finding** (48694002) | symptom (`moodChanges`) | Transient = symptom; persistent = condition (anxiety disorder 197480006) |
| Weight fluctuations | — (derived measurement) | quantity (`bodyMass`) | Not a symptom — computed from weight tracking |

**HDS approach:** Model these as self-reported symptom observations (FHIR `Observation` category `symptom`), not conditions. The same concept can exist as both a symptom item (self-reported presence) and a condition in a clinical context — the FHIR resource type determines the interpretation.

## Design Considerations

### Event type options for symptoms

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| `activity/plain` (presence + duration) | Simple, matches Ovia/most apps. Duration captures "how long". | No severity. |
| `ratio/proportion` (0-1 scale) | Captures severity. Maps to Apple HealthKit Mild/Moderate/Severe. | More complex. Not all sources provide severity. |
| Both: `activity/plain` as base, extend to `ratio/proportion` later | Start simple, add severity when needed per symptom. | Item version management. |

### Severity mapping (if ratio/proportion is used)

| Apple HealthKit | Ratio value | Label |
|---|---|---|
| NotPresent (1) | 0.0 | None |
| Mild (2) | 0.33 | Mild |
| Moderate (3) | 0.66 | Moderate |
| Severe (4) | 1.0 | Severe |

Mira's `level` field ("Mild", etc.) maps to the same scale.

### Naming conventions

Symptoms use long descriptive IDs for clarity:
- `symptom-gastrointestinal-nausea` (verbose, self-documenting)
- `sym-gi-nausea` (compact, needs legend)
- Decision: TBD based on existing HDS naming conventions

### Cross-boundary items

Some Mira concepts appear in multiple fields:
- **Acne**: appears in both `skin` field (as "Breaking out") and `symptoms` field (as "Acne"). In HDS, `body-skin-acne` exists under body/skin stream. When acne comes from the symptom field, should it map to the same item or a separate symptom item? See open questions below.
- **Anxiety/Stress**: appear in `symptoms` field AND overlap with `mood` field (5D mood vectors capture anxiety/stress as emotional states). These are complementary: symptom = "I have anxiety today", mood = "I feel anxious right now (valence=0.15, arousal=0.80)".

### Design decisions (settled 2026-03-17)

1. **Acne dual-source**: Mira's `symptoms.Acne` maps to existing `body-skin-acne` (reuse). Single item regardless of source — matches Apple HealthKit's single `acne` identifier.
2. **Anxiety/Stress**: No symptom items — captured only through mood 5D vectors (`wellbeing-mood`). Mira's Anxiety/Stress in symptoms field are skipped silently.
3. **Increased appetite**: Modeled as `nutrition-appetite` under new top-level `nutrition/` stream with `ratio/proportion` (0.25=decreased, 0.50=normal, 0.75=increased). Matches Apple HealthKit's 3-value `appetiteChanges` enum.
4. **Weight fluctuations**: Skipped — derived from body-weight measurements, not a symptom.
5. **Stream hierarchy**: Full clinical sub-categories under `symptom/` (gastrointestinal, pain, neurological, dermatological, sleep, metabolic, general) — ready for future items from HealthKit and other integrations.
